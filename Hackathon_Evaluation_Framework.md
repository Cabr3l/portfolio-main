## Introduction

Hackathons are intensive, time-constrained events where participants collaborate to solve complex problems through innovative solutions. Effective assessment of these solutions requires a structured, fair, and comprehensive evaluation framework that balances creativity with feasibility.

This document provides a detailed framework for evaluating hackathon solutions, with particular emphasis on environmental and sustainability-focused challenges.

## Key Challenges in Hackathon Assessment

### Time Constraints
- Limited development time (typically 24-48 hours)
- Rapid prototyping requirements
- Minimal testing and validation opportunities

### Participant Diversity
- Varied skill levels and backgrounds
- Different approaches to problem-solving
- Mixed technical and non-technical expertise

### Evaluation Complexity
- Subjective assessment of innovation
- Balancing creativity with practicality
- Ensuring fair comparison across project types

### Solution Validation
- Limited time for thorough testing
- Difficulty in assessing long-term impact
- Challenge of measuring scalability
